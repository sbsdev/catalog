Essentialy the system is a small service where dumps of the library
database can be uploaded and catalogs in various formats downloaded.
There will be a web interface to download catalogs and, if this cannot
be automated, also to upload database exports from the library
database.

A database will contain all items. The catalogs will be produced based
on those items.

** configuration and Dependencies
Configuration is fairly complex and involves a lot of dependencies. It
is recommended to use the [[https://github.com/sbsdev/sbs-infrastructure/blob/master/catalog.yml][ansible installation script]] which automates
the whole process.

Amongst other you will need [[http://wildfly.org/][Wildfly]], LaTeX, etc.
