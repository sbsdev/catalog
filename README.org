Essentialy the system is a small service where dumps of the library
database can be uploaded and catalogs in various formats downloaded.
There is a web interface to download catalogs and, if this cannot be
automated, also to upload database exports from the library database.

A database contains all items. The catalogs are produced based on
those items.

** Configuration and Dependencies
Installation and configuration can be done using an [[https://github.com/sbsdev/sbs-infrastructure/blob/master/kati.yml][ansible
installation script]] which automates the whole process.

Mostly you will need [[http://wildfly.org/][Wildfly]], and some fonts.
